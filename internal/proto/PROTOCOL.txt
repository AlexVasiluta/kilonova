/***** /Submission Procedure\ *******/

/************** /Protocol\ ***************/

/**************   Types  *****************/
Compile - compile submission and save the executable somewhere
		- args:
			- "code": string = source code to compile
			- "lang": string = language key as defined in internal/proto/types.go
			- "id": int = ID that corresponds to this submission

CResponse - Response for a Compile message
		- args:
			- "id": int = ID to the corresponding compiled submission
		  	- "output": string = compilation output
			- "success": bool = determine if it was successful
			- "other": string = other errors that might happen

Test - Test: add submission with specified input to queue
		- args:
			- "id": int = ID of executable to be run
			- "tid": int = ID of the test that is currently run, used for TResponse
			- "input": string = test input
			- "filename": string = if "input", then stdin is used, otherwise the filename to save the input to
			- "timelimit": float = time limit (in seconds), 0 for no limits
			- "memorylimit": int = memory limit (in kilobytes), 0 for no limits
			- "stacklimit": int = stack limit (in kilobytes), 0 for no limits

TResponse - Test response (note that it is the client's responsibility to validate output)
		- args:
			- "tid": int = the "tid" specified in Test
			- "output": string = test output
			- "time": float = time taken (in seconds)
