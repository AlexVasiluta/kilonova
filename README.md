Kilonova is a (work-in-progress) platform for competitive programming.

NOTE: Since the protocol used to talk to the worker will use (it hasn't yet been implemented, TODO) net.ErrClosed (implemented in golang/go@e9ad52e46dee4b4f9c73ff44f44e1e234815800f during the go 1.16 merge window), you need either a go version compiled from the master branch or 1.16 when it eventually comes out.
